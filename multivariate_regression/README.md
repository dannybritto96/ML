Abstract: NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel.

This problem has the following inputs: 
1. Frequency, in Hertzs. 
2. Angle of attack, in degrees. 
3. Chord length, in meters. 
4. Free-stream velocity, in meters per second. 
5. Suction side displacement thickness, in meters. 

The only output is: 
6. Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels.
