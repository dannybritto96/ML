<br/>

A multi-layer perceptron has been built to classify masses as benign or malignant based on its features.
Grid search of hyperparameters was implemented to find the best paramters for the neural network from the defined dictionary.

The output of the GridSearchCV from Keras is implemented to a Neural network.

The output of GridSearchCV i.e., the best paramters list and best accuracy can be found in the screenshot in this folder.
